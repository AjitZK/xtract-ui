The furniture you could have waited months to sell through classified ads or on supermarket notice boards could be sold in a matter of minutes at The Auction House Dubai – and for more than you had ever hoped.

Each auction is full of suspense, excitement – and drama! When bidders compete, the atmosphere is electric! The audience holds its breath, waiting for the final bid and the auctioneer to bang his gavel to conclude the sale. But what price has been reached? It’s all part of the unique auction experience.

And it’s not just for adults. Kids can come along and join in the fun as spectators. There is a huge bouncy castle monitored at all times by an adult, ice cream and plenty of refreshment for Mum and Dad, too.

During 1977 then Pier Carioggia started his cooperation with Giorgio Circossa who pretty soon became a share holder of the company. The cooperation went on for more than 30 years until Giorgio unfortunately passed away in 2007.

In 1983 the two friends moved the gallery from via S.Agostino to C. Siccardi n° 15 and in 1993 to the actual facility in C.Tassoni 56.

It is worth to mention the exhibition which has been organized for the inauguration of the C. Siccardi location , named “the giants of 900”, which exhibited a large number of masterpieces of XIX century, among many others few De Chirico of 920 years, including “Les jeux terrible” of 1925, the famous “Risveglio dela bionda sirena” of Scipione, few Savinio and other works of Sironi, Morandi, De Pisis, Rosai, Campigli, Carra etc.

Also for the opening of the C.Tassoni location, which was chosen to get enough room to have the auctions in house, S. Agostino organized the exhibition of the works of Bonzagni which was showing almost all the important paintings of the great master, who has been one of the subscriber of the first “futurism notice”

The first auction in the new facility was the 44th and did take place in may 1993.

As from than S. Agostino has growing constantly, selling more and more works of great interest like the extraordinary “ingegnere” of Sironi, sold for € 450.000, during the 84th auction of Nov, 17, 2003. 

Even if the core business of S. Agostino is always the works of 800, 900 and contemporary art, lately the auctions have included antique art, antique furniture, design, watches, jewels and silverware with a good success in term of sold lots as well as prices."

Casino Over Under LLC,http://casinooverunder.com/,Gambling & Casinos,"     Casino Over Under LLC was formed for the sole purpose of distributing new casino table game Casino Over Under® to casinos around the world. The game is next set to debut in Washington state at The Point Casino and Hotel in Kingston, WA in December. 
     While most new table games are almost always a variant of poker or BJ this game is not! It is a true original counting game based on the O/U concept used in sports wagering. After seeing their first of three cards a player must guess if their three card total will be over 23 or under 18. There is also a separate bonus option that can hit for big money for really high overs and/or low unders. 
     The game's easy going flow and not having to beat a dealer hand make it an excellent game for those that are normally too intimidated to play table games. Just the same with just three cards deciding every hand; the 2nd and 3rd of which are dealt back to back, COU has a torrid hands/hr rate that exceeds BJ!
     There are app versions in both appstores and also an HTML5 for online along with a program for it to be played as a stadium ETG. Currently licensed in Mississippi, Washington and soon to be Pennsylvania. "

This new company was dedicated to selling all types of proprietary products to chain drug, variety, hardware and department stores.

The company remains owned and managed by the Gutterman family.  Alison became the president of Jelmar in 2007 and the third generation Gutterman to run the company.  Much of Jelmar’s recent successes can be attributed to Alison’s commitment to build on Jelmar’s base and to expand research and development of quality cleaning products.  Most recently Alison expanded Jelmar’s product offering with the introduction of PRO Line, an industrial line of cleaning products.

Alison has increased Jelmar’s investment in consumer research to gain insights into what consumers are looking for in their cleaning products.

Wellness Providers Network,http://wellnessprovidersnetwork.com/,"Health, Wellness & Fitness","Our Vision

Over the past 40 years, the landscape of the healing professions has undergone radical changes. Models of therapy that were once considered mainstream have fallen out of favor and innovative ones once frowned upon,  are now part of the established tradition. The overall emphasis has shifted from models of treatments based on pathology or crisis, to those aimed at facilitating a lifestyle of well-being,  joy and fulfillment.

Wellness Providers Network considers mind/body/spirit interventions equally viable for producing positive change as more “traditional” forms of  healthcare. There are myriad narratives for healing and innumerable means of intervention for every life dilemma. We  appreciate the originality and creativity of holistic practitioners who are interested as much in the art as the science of well-being. Choosing one should be informed by knowledge of the widest range of models and methods available.

We are a network of providers from around the globe who possess the imagination, technology, and skills that bring real creativity and choice to those seeking to realize a joyful and fulfilling life. We strive to contribute to a new consciousness regarding contemporary mental health and health practices and their delivery throughout the world."

Providers,http://providersma.com/,Construction,"Providers is a referral service, based in Massachusetts, that will match you with a specific licensed contractor or company that is best suited for your project. All of our references are background checked and drug tested at random. Whether it's a one hundred dollar or a million dollar project, Providers won't just hand your project off to a few contractors that will call you at their convenience or miss appointments. For the duration of your project, Providers will ensure that all work is satisfactory and completed in a timely manner.

Our History
Kevin Brady, President and Founder, decided to start Providers after years of watching companies make false promises. He saw that the quality of workmanship had steadily declined with materials battered around in shipping docks, loading bays and unsecured delivery trucks. Site inspections were being performed by people who were more concerned about where their company sign was placed on the lawn rather than whether their sub-contractors were qualified. Kevin saw that customer satisfaction was an afterthought, if a concern at all.
 
When Kevin spoke to contractors about the quality of their leads, the response was that referral services provide leads that only produce work if they are the first to respond. This process is useless to contractors and a disservice to customers, who are often given limited options or are even dissuaded from doing work that they need."
Hilfe Billing Providers Co.,N/A,Information Technology & Services,"Executive Summary
In today’s rapidly evolving healthcare environment, providers not only have to concentrate on the patients but also keep a keen eye on the bottom line of their practice. However, complex payer guidelines and evolving regulations tend to adversely affect the practice’s financial health if billing is not done in a prompt and accurate manner.
Studies indicate that medical practices can lose a significant percentage of their potential revenue due to various factors ranging from down coding to late filing. Statistics show that down coding and denials (which are usually not appealed) can cause a substantial loss in revenue if not dealt efficiently. Therefore for a larger practice, the losses can be even higher.
 
HILFE BILLING PROVIDERS offers a flexible portfolio of medical billing services ranging from simple follow-ups to comprehensive revenue cycle management without disrupting the existing processes of your practice.
 
Our mission is therefore to increase your revenue by following up on any claims, denials, resubmissions and rejections, further coming up with the best professional and technical advice to avoid any future hurdles or delays in your revenue stream.
 
With comparatively lesser rates and designated account managers Hilfe Billing Providers makes an attempt to provide prolific results and eliminate any loopholes present in your current billing process."
